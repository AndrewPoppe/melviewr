Title: View and Classify MELODIC Output for ICA+FIX
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Andrew", "Poppe", email = "Poppe076@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The melviewr package provides a graphical interface that allows the
    user to easily view and classify MELODIC output for the purposes of later 
    running ICA+FIX. The user categorizes a component as signal or noise based on 
    its spatial characteristics as well as its temporal profile. melviewr can then 
    save a text file of these classifications in the format required by ICA+FIX.
