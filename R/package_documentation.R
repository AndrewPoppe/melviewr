#' melviewr: A viewer for MELODIC output and ICA+FIX classification.
#'
#' The melviewr package allows the user to easily view and classify
#' MELODIC output for the purposes of later running ICA+FIX. The user
#' categorizes a component as signal or noise based on its spatial
#' characteristics as well as its temporal profile. melviewr can then save
#' a text file of these classifications in the format required by ICA+FIX.
