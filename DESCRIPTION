Title: View and Classify MELODIC Output for ICA+FIX
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: person("Andrew", "Poppe", email = "Poppe076@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides a graphical interface that allows the user to easily view 
    and classify output from 'MELODIC', a part of the 'FSL' neuroimaging analysis
    software suite that performs independent component analysis (ICA; see 
    <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/MELODIC/> for more information). The 
    user categorizes a component as signal or noise based on its spatial and 
    temporal characteristics and can then save a text file of these 
    classifications in the format required by 'ICA+FIX', an automatic noise 
    removal tool (<https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FIX>).
